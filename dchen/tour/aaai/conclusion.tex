We cast the problem of recommending trajectories as a special case of sequence recommendation,
which we solve by augmenting structured SVMs.
This approach not only ensures global cohesion, but also accounts for the existence of multiple ground truths for a given input.
We also propose a novel application of the list Viterbi algorithm to avoid predicting loops in the sequence.
Experiments on real-world trajectory datasets show that
sequence recommendation approaches outperform existing, non-structured approaches.

%as a structured prediction problem.
%Our solution extends structured SVMs to account for two challenges:
%(1) the existence of multiple ground truths;
%(2) avoiding predicting loops in the sequence.
%The inference procedures are novel applications of the list Viterbi algorithm.

Our viewpoint enables researchers to bring recent advances in structured prediction
to bear on {\trajrec} problems,
including further improving the efficiency of inference and learning.
In the other direction, techniques from recommender systems to capture latent
user- and POI-representations, in sufficiently rich domains, may
improve the predictive power of structured prediction models.

%As a final remark, we note the cast of trajectory recommendation as a sequence recommendation problem
%is equally applicable to other applications.
%Further, the assumption that the output $\y$ is a sequence does not limit the generality of our approach,
%as inferring $\y$ of other structures can be achieved using corresponding inference and loss-augmented inference algorithms~\cite{joachims2009predicting},
%we leave this exploration as future work.
