\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problem}

We first introduce three cold-start settings for playlist recommendation, 
then summarise recent work most related to recommend music to form playlists,
as well as music recommendation in cold-start scenarios.



\subsection{Three cold-start settings}

We investigate problems of recommending music to form playlists in the following three cold-start settings:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \emph{cold playlists}, where we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for an existing user;
\item \emph{cold songs}, where we recommend newly released songs to extend existing playlists;
\item \emph{cold users}, where we recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist for a new user.
\end{enumerate}

%We address the three cold-start settings using one approach, namely, we first score each song 
%according to the given information (\eg an existing playlist, an existing user or a new user),
%%then we can form a playlist by either taking the top-K scored songs or sampling songs proportional to their scores.
%then take the top scored songs as our recommendation.
%Specifically, for the task of recommending newly released songs to extend an existing playlist $i$ from user $u$,
%we score each new song $m$ with respect to user $u$ and playlist $i$, as indicated by $\hat f(u, i, m)$.
%To recommend a set of songs for an existing user $u$,
%since there is no information about the desired playlist, we score each song $m$ with respect to only the user,
%as indicated by $\hat f(u, \cdot, m)$.
%Finally, we score each song $m$ by $\hat f(\cdot, \cdot, m)$ when recommending a set of songs 
%for a new user with no additional information.

Suppose we are given a dataset $\DCal$ with $N$ playlists from $U$ users, 
where songs in every playlist are from a music collection with $M$ songs.
We further assume each user has at least one playlist, and each song in the collection 
is appeared in at least one playlist.

We illustrate the three cold-start settings in Figure~\ref{fig:settings},
where rows represent songs and columns represent playlists.
If entry $(m, n)$ is \texttt{1} (or \texttt{0}), it means song $m$ can (or not) be found in playlist $n$.
The shaded rows/columns with \texttt{?} mark represent the test set, where all entries are unknown.
In the \emph{cold songs} setting, we have a set of playlists (columns) formed by existing songs (rows),
and the task is to determine whether we should add each new song (row) to an existing playlist.
In the \emph{cold playlists} setting, we have a set of playlists (columns) from existing users,
and the task is to recommend a set of songs to form a new playlist (column) for an existing user.
Lastly, in the \emph{cold users} setting, which is similar to the {\it cold playlists} setting except
the target user to whom we will recommend a playlist is a new user, \ie the user
does not have any playlists in the system.
